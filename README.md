# CAPTCHA Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)







# Introduction
This repository contains a Python script for CAPTCHA recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The script processes a set of CAPTCHA images, extracts individual characters, and trains a CNN model to classify these characters.

# Project Overview
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security mechanism commonly used to distinguish between humans and automated bots. In this project, we leverage a dataset from Kaggle to train a CNN model that can recognize characters within CAPTCHA images. The process involves preprocessing the CAPTCHA images, building and training a CNN model, and evaluating its performance.
